## Changelog

**v1.1.0.0**

This version is a marker of a new release series, which is a cross-platform
modification of the original VSTi source code.
The functionality is mostly but not exactly identical to the original, and there
remain some minor items to be implemented.

- eliminated an audible click when retriggering a voice
- edited the picture to remove the brand name of the original instrument
- supported automation recording
- added tooltips to facilitate reading
- changed parameter domains to be human-readable
- fixed handling of calculator and ADSR memory, on a locale which uses "," as decimal separator
- immediate handling of MIDI messages, without a buffer
- resolved potential out-of-bound memory accesses
- supported multiple instances in the same host
- supported some new platforms and formats

**v1.0.?.?**

- imported upstream source code
- relicensed to `CC0-1.0 or MIT` by the author PolyValens
